- Polish: roll with user subset
- Polish: login screen remember choice
- Optional: Add contest option and contested room state if something goes wrong
- Code polishing: unify names to use camelcase in gui/client/server/room/user
- 

Client-side command validation

Late messages(after timeout) - solution: states ?
Server exception handling
Client exception handle on leave

IMPERATIVE: split large messages into series
Message length - limitation: possibly get the client to recieve parts of the message separately?
Dropout - what if first, what if middle, what if last? What if GM?

## ROADMAP 
Thu - GM dropout, dropout
future - user list selection?

## Questions:
Neceessary?: split large messages into series
User selection (for the roll)
Calculations
Encoding
Reconnects?
