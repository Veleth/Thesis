- Server command to get logs and check (add server room to logs)
- Optional: Dummies and unit testing
- Polish: commands (!roll !)
- Polish: login screen remember choice
- Optional: Add contest option and contested room state if something goes wrong

Client-side command validation

Late messages(after timeout) - solution: states ?
Server exception handling
Client exception handle on leave

IMPERATIVE: split large messages into series
Message length - limitation: possibly get the client to recieve parts of the message separately?
Dropout - what if first, what if middle, what if last? What if GM?

## ROADMAP:
Tue - GM dropout, dropout, further commands, polish GM roll area on GUI, client-side dropout
future - user list selection?
